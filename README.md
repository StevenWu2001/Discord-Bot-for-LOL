# Discord-Bot-for-LOL
A Discord Bot that fetches League of Legend player data from Riot API, hosted on Heroku. This bot can be used as quick way for player to check their game/rank status.

## A Quick Guide:
Since this bot is hosted remotely on Heroku, a **.env** file is required in order to run locally. It needs to look something like the following:
```
BOTTOKEN = #YOUR DISCORD BOT TOKEN
RIOTKEY = #YOUR RIOT API KEY
```

You will need to create your own Discord bot from Discord's developer portal and copy the bot token there. The Riot API key can be obtained from Riot's API website.
